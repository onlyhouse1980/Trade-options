    ### üìö Glossary of Terms

    **Stock Ticker Symbol**: A unique series of letters assigned to a security for trading purposes (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.).

    **Options Contract**: A financial derivative that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a set price on or before a certain date.

    **Call Option**: An options contract that gives the holder the right to buy an asset at a specified price within a specific time period.

    **Strike Price**: The set price at which the option holder can buy (call option) or sell (put option) the underlying asset when the option is exercised.

    **Expiration Date**: The date on which the options contract becomes void and the right to exercise no longer exists.

    **Days Until Expiration**: The number of days left before the option's expiration date.

    **Last Price**: The most recent price at which the option was traded.

    **Bid Price**: The highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an option.

    **Ask Price**: The lowest price that a seller is willing to accept for an option.

    **Price Change**: The difference in the option's price from the previous day's closing price.

    **Percent Change**: The percentage change in the option's price from the previous day's closing price.

    **Volume**: The total number of option contracts traded during a specific period, typically a single trading day.

    **Open Interest**: The total number of outstanding option contracts that have not been settled or closed. Higher open interest indicates greater liquidity.

    **Implied Volatility (IV)**: A metric that reflects the market's view on the likelihood of changes in a security's price. Higher IV suggests that the market expects significant price movements.

    **Liquidity**: A measure of how easily an asset or security can be bought or sold in the market without affecting its price.

    **Premium**: The price that the buyer pays to the seller to acquire the option.

    **In-the-Money (ITM)**: A call option is "in the money" if the current price of the underlying asset is above the strike price.

    **Out-of-the-Money (OTM)**: A call option is "out of the money" if the current price of the underlying asset is below the strike price.

    **At-the-Money (ATM)**: An option is "at the money" if the current price of the underlying asset is equal to the strike price.

    ### ü§î Understanding Options Trading

    Options trading can be complex, but here are some basic concepts to help you get started:

    - **What Is an Option?**
      - An option is a contract that allows you to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price before a certain date.

    - **Why Trade Options?**
      - Options can provide leverage, allowing you to control a larger amount of stock with a smaller investment.
      - They can be used for hedging to protect against potential losses in your portfolio.
      - Options offer strategies for income generation through premium collection.

    - **Key Considerations:**
      - **Risk vs. Reward**: Options can offer high rewards but also come with high risks.
      - **Time Decay**: The value of options can decrease over time, especially as they approach expiration.
      - **Market Volatility**: Changes in market volatility can impact option prices.

    - **Getting Started:**
      - **Educate Yourself**: Before trading options, it's important to understand how they work.
      - **Paper Trading**: Consider practicing with a simulated trading account to gain experience without risking real money.
      - **Consult Professionals**: Seek advice from financial advisors or professionals if you're unsure.
